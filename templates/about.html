		<strong>May Mois</strong> is a play on words. <i>Mois</i> is French for month. The name, then, writes me and my poetry into the context of the universe as a whole. <br><br>
		I am a <div class="withcomment">non-binary <div class="comment">they/them pronouns</div></div> college student, self-diagnosed with poetry. 
		<br><br>
		In my poetry, I mosty look towards celebration or investigation. Celebration of life and its highs and lows is a concept dear to my heart. Not only the pleasures of life, but also its pains deserve to be understood and celebrated, though, it often happens in different ways.
		<br><br>
		On the other hand, investigation in my poetry often takes either a speculative or an introspective form. Other than language investigaton, which is another genre, investigation of the world for me involves looking within and looking out.
		<br><br>
		Language poetry, on the other hand, is more specific. It features an exploration of language as an always-evolving social construct. A lot of my poetry involves language exploration, but language poetry is specifically dedicated to this cause.
