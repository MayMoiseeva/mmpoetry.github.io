			<h3>Myth</h3>
			<img src="../images/eyes.png" class="banner" alt="Banner: teo diembodied eyes and leaves in the background.">
			Trust not my charming elfish song, 
			<br>let dreams be sleep, and world be gone. 
			<br>
			<br>You are not safe around these woods
			<br>where evil spirits live and brood,
			<br>you should have run while you still could. 
			<br>
			<br>***
			<br>
			<br>Avert your eyes; you must not 
			<br>look at me. As voices dot
			<br>your sleep with rose petals and leaves,
			<br>laying shells to your head for seas
			<br>to solace your heart and lead you to sleep,
			<br>
			<br>I look into your closed eyes, your deep
			<br>soul, kind and tender, guarded by your eyelids. 
			<br>You are the essence of beauty world forbids, 
			<br>reality shaken into entropy by existence 
			<br>of perfection of lips that are not to be kissed. Tense
			<br>
			<br>and vulgar are tense and voice of the phrase, yet
			<br>sanity discovers the Big Bang in tête-a-tête 
			<br>we won’t ever have. You are not to come 
			<br>to my doorstep, the sea shore and numb
			<br>with my overflow thick forest. Caress 
			<br>of your fingers is ecstasy, largesse
			<br>of the Universe does not extend to permitting 
			<br>me. I tremble in contempt at the thought of committing 
			<br>
			<br>such an atrocity as drowning in your ocean
			<br>or inhaling your flawless scent. Your caution
			<br>is non-existent, trust fatally unreserved. Heed
			<br>my warning and run; I see you bleed
			<br>under my thorn, enthralled, you do not plead 
			<br>for salvation. I am starved for the mead
			<br>and wine of your sorrow and pleasure.
			<br>In the Bard’s words, measure for measure,
			<br>
			<br>yet I have nothing to give to Astraea, my sea
			<br>dry as my chapped lips. I loathe the glee
			<br>that bursts in my chest when I see the naked skin 
			<br>of your chaste wrist. Your neck and heart, pristine,
			<br>have never known my touch. I feel the metal
			<br>of your liquor on my tongue and revel
			<br>in the passion that consumes me whole. 
			<br>You are bewitched, I wish to save the soul 
			<br>that lead Ananke to my dwelling; her curse
			<br>will not wear off with your sleep, my verse
			<br>as young as the night, too green to catch 
			<br>the harmony of you; such grace can match 
			<br>the taste of nectar and must not decay
			<br>
			<br>under the sky. C’est mon debut: I pray. 
			<br>No god will speak to me, my life akin
			<br>to the emerging bruises on your skin;
			<br>the fruit that leads the path to carnal sin,
			<br>you, surely, are as white and chaste within. 
			<br>While Pothos casts his cruellest of spells,
			<br>oh, let me find a way, let me rebel, 
			<br>not spoil thee with wicked noxious touch;
			<br>
			<br>desire clouds my vision, lust as hutch
			<br>encaptures me; the pantheon be damned
			<br>if I let thee rot; with my own hand
			<br>I close your neck that pearls would only rob
			<br>of beauty; bless, my darling, not a sob
			<br>
			<br>escapes your lips that I bend down to kiss
			<br>to steal your voice and breath and grant you bliss.
			<br>I drink you in, your spirit in my core
			<br>
			<br>and beauty in my arms. Forevermore 
			<br>thou will be beautiful and young and chaste at heart;
			<br>
			<br>thy body’s fate’s to know my black art.

			<h3>A spell over a garden plant</h3>
			Listen to me, mother, 
			<br>listen.
			<br>All we are is cruising in an ocean of despair.
			<br>A sister, a brother,
			<br>no clue as to what’s fair.
			<br>Keep them happy and well.
			<br>
			<br>All we ever have is each other
			<br>and anything that we share,
			<br>so each one’s a lover,
			<br>so everyone’s taking care.
			<br>Keep them safe and sound.
			<br>
			<br>There’s no other place to call home,
			<br>the warmth is sold out,
			<br>the world’s cold as stone.
			<br>But no one’s without
			<br>a mother.
			<br>Keep them alive and loved. 
			<br>
			<br>Listen to me, mother.
			<br>A sister, a brother,
			<br>make sure they’re here,
			<br>and as for me, dear...
			<br>Keep them well.

			<h3>Of love and madness</h3>
			Entranced by gentle glow of the light,
			<br>I let myself be led to summer glory.
			<br>
			<br>Relapse means I might never be alright,
			<br>But with a breath I start another story
			<br>Of anything and everything at once,
			<br>Whilst keeping secrets from my self-perception.
			<br>And as I cry, the nightmares start to dance
			<br>And chant as every single recollection
			<br>Is written off as side of medication,
			<br>And stars start screaming out, shining in
			<br>to bedroom's window, and the incantations
			<br>illuminated, light the more serene
			<br>the more it is the only starts' salvation
			<br>that's brought upon them in the death of still
			<div class="indent">
				and universal hum: they burn away
				<br>while their silent screams just plead to stay.
			</div>
			<br>
			<br>Ahoy, my fair warrior, behold,
			<br>My lady, sign of full compassion.
			<br>And thus I name theequeen, now not cold,
			<br>but merciless, the dame of my confessions.
			<br>My love, my queen, allow me a kiss
			<br>Before my soul fails to exist,
			<br>Before the universe my screams will cease
			<br>To hear let me go in bliss.
			<div class="indent">
				My love, my queen, allow thy fair knight
				<br>A kiss of love, thy bliss and death in fight.</div>

			<h3>Musing on divinity of self</h3>
			<h5>pre. <br><br>
			I say, ‘The best of morn,’ to lilac sky, forgiving, and forsaken and divine; I only travel out of my sly desire to perceive and to define. </h5>
			* # @ -
			<br>
			<br>The best of all the obvious convictions, 
			<br>Insanity of love, thee laid to rest. 
			<br>I only know the terms, but not conditions 
			<br>And play for years innocent caress; 
			<br>I paint with colours, veils and comprehension, 
			<br>You only see the sound's shaky haste. 
			<br>Our gray-blue sky is full of complications 
			<br>And of the sweetest fruit's forbidden taste. 
			<br>
			<br>Your very own sign on window sill, 
			<br>And oh-so-lovely cigarettes with coffee 
			<br>Are shaping preciously the very peel 
			<br>Of every one of us: of steel with toffee. 
			<br>We're young and stressed, and mostly on the pill 
			<br>Of freedom-gifting packets of endorphins. 
			<br>Allow each of us the toxic thrill 
			<br>Of seeing our calm be dark and stormy.
			<br>
			<br>And now, darling, time for misconceptions 
			<br>Regarding why, and how, and when to live.
			<br>Your ever-so classical receptions 
			<br>of seasonal affections, 
			<br>imperfections, 
			<br>polarity of mind and the directions
			<br>that follows every tired autumn leaf.
			<br>
			<br>Thus, following the cycle of redemption,
			<br>I met a shadow, looking through the sun. 
			<br>It was but every gem in my collection, 
			<br>left by the moon unsettled and undone. 
			<br>Decisive hand closed up against the heartache,
			<br>Considering to whether give it hope
			<br>Or giving in to order of the lilac 
			<br>Burn out the ears, eyes, and tongue, and throat.
			<br>
			<br>Breath hitched; and voicing every second action
			<br>It started off to break against the glass.
			<br>The splinters hardly being a distraction,
			<br>The shadow lost its soul as well as trust.
			<br>It took a leap, like a bird born in a cage that always looked for loneliness, for freedom, for the voice that said it would take it anywhere in the world.
			<br>It took a leap of confidence in hope,
			<br>In freedom and in infinite a sky,
			<br>Just blazed with turquoise. And thus, through coat 
			<br>Of shining light with silent purple cry 
			<br>I took a leap.
			<br>
			<br>And suddenly I was wind-carried flight, 
			<br>Across the sky and over the horizon;
			<br>I wept and looked and stared with eyes wide
			<br>As all the world at once began to whiten
			<br>And spin and turn, directions start to hide
			<br>along with memories; and sanity of existence did not exist outside of the fairy tale my mom told at bedtime. It covered all the possible scenarios, but it eliminated the impossible and that was its mistake as if we’re here, we’re here for never.
			<br>
			<br>I realised I was in love with implications 
			<br>Of imperfections; every single turn 
			<br>I used to tire out the vacations 
			<br>Of void, to make the shadows burn. 
			<br>
			<br>Of storm I said that it’s a passerby, 
			<br>Allowed by its nature but a glimpse 
			<br>On what this life looks like; I didn’t lie,
			<br>But neither did I say to all my nymphs 
			<br>I was supposed as a storm turned butterfly 
			<br>That was forever cold against the window,
			<br>But I decide to burn away my life,
			<br>Thus came the rain. Only gentle willow
			<br>that weeps and works forever since the dawn of time would keep me close, would love me, and thus came ponds of tears I could not shed and rivers, and the oceans, and I made hurricanes, because my willow taught me so, a little child prepared to glow
			<br>
			<br>in the night sky. It held the unexplored
			<br>and wonders of the same divisive fraction.
			<br>I wasn’t startled by the loud chord 
			<br>That played along my step. It was attraction
			<br>to glory and to fame that fade away
			<br>Although it’s easier to leave now than to stay.
			<br>
			<br>And so it was written across the lilac sky: I was once and forever, I was one with the stars and the moons, I was the least and the most, the none and the all, and I was the willow that guided me, and the shadow stepped back into the dark and the willow smirked and the voices started screaming.
			<br>
			<br>And I awoke in the middle of the Universe, floating with only myself. I was the lilac sky and all the colours and all the voices guiding to serenity. 
			<br>
			<br>I smiled and let it flow, taking a liquorice from the kitchen table and feeling all the calmness in the world and I knew what that leap was for. 
			<br>
			<br>And now the peace with one left no doubt 
			<br>Of me and world
			<br>That in my hand unfurled.
			<br>The joy was cloud
			<br>I knew it was what love is all about.
